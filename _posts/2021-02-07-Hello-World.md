This website is intended for publishing articles and tutorials on topics about programming, electronics and technology in general - *and* **everything** in between.

I have always been curious about learning new stuff and how things work. I also enjoy teaching others, aand this is where this website fits in. By teaching others, I feel like I gain a different (more in depth) understanding on the topic - which I love!

## Why **Virtual Geek**?

**Virtual Geek** is a name I adopted way back in 2012. I had just started getting into programming, and wanted to be able to share thoughts and ideas regarding programming, and thus the need for a name arised.

The definition of *Virtual* and *Geek* is as follows:

> Virtual: (*adjective*) not physically existing as such but made by software to appear to do so.

> Geek: (*noun*) a knowledgeable and obsessive enthusiast.

Combined, we get:

> A knowledgeable and obsessive enthusiast, not physically existing as such but made by software to appear to do so.

Which I think is suitable, given that **this** is in fact on *the Internet*, which we all are by definition *not physically existing as such, but rather made by software to appear to do so*.

I hope you will enjoy this fun and knowledgeable journey with me!
